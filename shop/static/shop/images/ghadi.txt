Organic food and all the colours of nature inspired the making of this wooden wall clock! The clock is one to have in your kitchen or dining room to go along with the theme of food. Made of wood, the clockâ€™s face is surrounded by little pockets of multi-coloured pulses in different shapes and sizes and just lights up any wall it ends up hanging on! Makes for a great gift as well!

P.S. Batteries are not included.
